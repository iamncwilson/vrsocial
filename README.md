# vrsocial
Compeditor to vrchat and vircadia built ontop of the Godot engine

For now this project will be more of a social vr code playground untill Godot 4.0 is released with vulkan support.

When 4.0 comes out depending on weather the current codebase is solid or not and how much work needs to be done to port this project over to 4.0, I/We may decide to completely rewrite the code from scratch using the knowledge and expirience we gained developing this version.

Pretty much I want to make mistakes building this project now and learn form them when we/I do the big rewrite

Feel free to come chat over on the official discord https://discord.gg/g7GpVgd
If this project ever takes on more than a couple devs I switch to an official matrix server or something in the spirit of using opensource software to communicate.
