# vrsocial
Compeditor to vrchat and vircadia built ontop of the Godot engine

For now this project will be more of a social vr code playground untill Godot 4.0 is released with vulkan support.

When 4.0 comes out depending on weather the current codebase is solid or not and how much work needs to be done to port this project over to 4.0, I/We may decide to completely rewrite the code from scratch using the knowledge and expirience we gained developing this version.

Pretty much I want to make mistakes building this project now and learn form them when we/I do the big rewrite

Feel free to come chat over on the official discord https://discord.gg/g7GpVgd
If this project ever takes on more than a couple devs I switch to an official matrix server or something in the spirit of using opensource software to communicate.

Goals
- Pick a better name (I like names that imply function but all the obvious names are taken
- Federated chatrooms
- Federated authentication + friend storage + ability to seemlessly switch which authentication server you are signed up with
- Bittorrent community content distribution solution (So people can run there own server without using a massive amount of bandwidth)
- As much encryption as possible without degrading expirience (End to End if possible (Maybe just on voice and not on IK))
- Actually having a working prototype with basic chat functionality (In progress)
